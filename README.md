# AdventOfCode2022

In this repo I will try to publish my solutions for the Advent of Code Challenge 2022. My personal goal is, to learn the language Ruby by solving the puzzles with this programming language.

Feel free to join on the journey towards an (hopefully) advanced Ruby programmer.

It was a bumpy start with a lot of searching on stackoverflow and the documentation for Ruby. Finally, I found a solution which is working and pretty straight forward. I tried also to get the data directly from the AoC website but here I struggled.
